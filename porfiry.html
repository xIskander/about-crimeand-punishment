				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book Crime and Punishment, Porfiry Petrovich is quite the interesting character and very skilled detective. 
					As the chief investigator in the murder case that the book is mostly about, he is and could simbolize being intelligent, very manipulative, and very good 
					at his work as an investigator. Porfiry Petrovich is a very intellectual person and has quite the great understanding of human nature. With this great understanding of human nature,
					he was able to see through and identify Raskolnikov's lies. Porfiry is also a person who looks closely at peoples behaviors and is definitely someone you cannot
					lie to. Whenever he has a conversation with a suspect like Raskolnikov or a witness, he is very good at probing them for information that could be an admission
					to what he is trying to get. In addition, Porfiry seems to have this ability to predict Raskolnikov's next move and can manipulate him into saying something that could
					prove his guilt. Porfiry is also a very patient and persistent person that will not give up. He is also someone who values psychological evidence to find if the crime was true as well.
					Porfiry soon starts to sense Raskolnikov's guilt and starts to say things that are very manipulative once more. With his tactics, Porfiry sort of baits Raskolnikov,
					into him almost confessing to the murders. This also shows how he is very committed to justice and bringing criminals to justice such as Raskolnikov.
					Besides the psychological stuff, Porfiry personality is definitely a weird one as he is very reserved while closely watching the people around him and seems
					to be always on alert. In addition, when Porfiry would talk with Raskolnikov, he would seem to show some sort of empathy and he would understand him in a certain way.
					He seems to comprehend the psychological torment Raskolnikov experiences, hinting at a shared understanding of the duality of human nature.</p>
