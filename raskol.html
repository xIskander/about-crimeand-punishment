				<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raskolnikov is a quite troubled character who went through a lot psychological and emotional torture throughout this book. Raskolnikov who is a former student that is living in St. Petersburg that is convinced that he is above the law and can commit murder without remorse if it is "absolutely necessary".

					Raskolnikov's belief in this idea that he is above the law is challenged when he murders an old pawnbroker and her sister. Despite his idea that the murders were "necessary", he is quickly filled with guilt and paranoia. The psychological and emotional torture of his crime becomes simply too much and he soon confesses to the murder.
					
					In addition, Raskolnikov tries to deal with his own beliefs about the "purpose of existence" and is tormented by his ideas about the either good or evil actions he has done. When he would interact with other characters in this book, including his friend Razumikhin and that prostitute Sonya, soon make him see how much internal struggle and the conflicting beliefs that controlled his actions.
					
					Raskolnikov soon has redemption Through his suffering and confession, and begings to understand his ways and the true nature of human connection, as he has distanced him self quite a bit from it. When he would talk with Sonya, he would show his growing empathy and how we may want to take responsibility for his actions.
					
					Raskolnikov's story is one that is about redemption and "self-discovery" you could say. He would learn the how his beliefs can influence his actions and how his actions have consequences.  He also understands the importance of being a good person and how connections with other people, it a good thing. Raskolnikov could be considered a cautionary tale about the dangers of being insecure about your beliefs and how forgiving people which he did in the end it always something good.</p>
